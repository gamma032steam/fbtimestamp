# Facebook/Messenger Time Stamp Collector

Simple JS web script to track the timestamps of all messages in a messenger chat. Requires some JS and Excel knowledge to operate and clean the data.

1. Edit the class name (inspect element on any message in the chat to find the ID)
2. Edit the number of loop iterations to the number of messages (may need to guess/work upwards)

Use:
1. Open messenger
2. Load all messages (hold scroll wheel and move to the top of the convo)
3. Run script in the web console
4. Copy data
